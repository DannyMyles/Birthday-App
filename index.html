        In Ghana, an Outdooring (Ga: kpodziemo; Akan: abadinto) <br>
         is the traditional naming ceremony for infants. <br>
          Traditionally this ceremony occurs eight days after <br>
           the child is born where parents bring their newborn "outdoors" <br>
            for the first time and give the child a day name. Cultural beliefs <br>
             dictated that after eight days, the infant was likely to survive <br>
              and could be provided a name. In addition to the day name, <br>
               Ghanaians frequently give children a name of an elder relative, <br>
               either living or deceased. During the Outdooring, male infants <br>
                would be circumcised and female infants would have their ears pierced <br></p>


                <p>Frequently, children are given their first name <br>
                     as a 'day name' which corresponds to the day in the <br>
                       week they were born. Here are Ghanian day names. <br></p>
